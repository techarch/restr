== 0.4.0 :: 2008-06-19

* You can set how long Restr will wait for a request to complete by  setting 
  Restr.request_timeout = <seconds>. The default timeout is 3  minutes 
  (180 seconds).
* The full response body is now included in DEBUG-level log entries. Be careful
  if you have the logging level set to DEBUG -- your log will now grow very
  quickly.

== 0.3.0 :: 2008-04-03

* First public release -- moved out from the Reststop library into its own gem.
